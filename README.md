## Horticulture Environment Arduino Resource Terminal

##### "Blossoming Possibilities, One HEART at a Time"

The Horticulture Environment Arduino Resource Terminal, dubbed as Project HEART, is designed to address a range of agricultural challenges, including low crop yields and food security concerns while bridging the longstanding gap in research and development within the industry. The basis of it is its forefront sensor technology, which has the power to completely transform the Philippine agriculture industry. There is a sizable market and a pressing need for such a creative technique as farming occupies over 40% of the country's territory and employs almost five million people. 

To optimize agricultural methods, conserve resources, and increase output, this project provides farmers with real-time data and insights through the deployment of high-quality sensors that can be controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. This technology not only offers economic benefits but also aligns with sustainable and eco-conscious farming practices, making it a pivotal step forward in bolstering agricultural resilience and productivity in the Philippines, in the form of horticulture.

Potential commercial applications of this invention can be targeted with the budding urban farming communities and horticulture areas like greenhouses as its beneficiaries, with the goal of this invention being to support food security within the functionalities of the said product. Further development of the product may enable it to be more compact and effective in performing the said functionalities. This project is available to be edited by anyone, just contact us for details.
